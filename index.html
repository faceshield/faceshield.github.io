      <p contentEditable role='textbox' aria-multiline='true'>The COVID-19 situation is changing and changing fast. As the need for personal protective equipment (PPE) is in high demand, it is very difficult for our healthcare workers to receive proper protection. We are striving to deliver thousands of PPE's for hospitals, doctors, nurses, ambulance, and dental professionals, using our 3D printers to create face shields. Some of these are local to our SF Bay Area but others are around the country too!<br><br>
      Costs of filament, transparency sheets, sheet protectors, and shipping are increasing, and your donations will help us to cover these costs that our team of 8 here in Pleasanton incur.<br><br>
